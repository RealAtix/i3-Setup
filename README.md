# Second i3-Setup Fall Update

This is a simple update.

Nothing has changed really. Just colors and wallpaper. 

Click Commands on Volume and Music Titles.
Music click toggle play pause. Might add mute or clear playlist on right or middle button.
Volume is standard I3 Blocks volume script. 

.i3status.conf is not needed for this setup.

Happy Fall/Autumn/Halloween. Go Eagles!
