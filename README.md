# Warhammer Setup

Switched to I3 Blocks.

There are click commands on volume and music titles.
Music click toggle play pause. Might add mute or clear playlist on right or middle button.
Volume is standard I3 Blocks volume script. 



Besides from that it is pretty much the same from my first riceroni.
